Visualize:

Time-averaged traffic map -> see which area is busy
Salt lake city -> precipitation & weather (time-series)  

Time-series -> grouped by the weekdays, and weekend -> see the working impact (bar chart)  

Time -series -> grouped by precipitation, and no -precipitation -> see precipitation can cause less traffic volume (bar chart)
